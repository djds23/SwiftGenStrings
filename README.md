# SwiftGenStrings

SwiftGenStrings is a command line application that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the standard `genstrings` command for Swift sources. The latter only supports the short form of the `NSLocalizedString` function but breaks as soon as you use any parameters other than `key` and `comment` as in

```
NSLocalizedString("DATE_RANGE", value: "%@ â€“ %@", comment: "A range of dates")
```

The upstream issue is tracked [here](https://openradar.appspot.com/22133811).

## Usage

```
SwiftGenStrings files
SwiftGenStrings [-s <routine>] [-o <outputDir>] files
SwiftGenStrings [-h|--help]

OPTIONS
-h|--help
    (Optional) Print help.
-s routine
    (Optional) Substitute routine for NSLocalizedString, useful when different macro is used.
-o outputDir
    (Optional) Specifies what directory Localizable.strings table is created in.
    Not specifying output directory will print script output content to standard output (console).
files
    List of files, that are used as source of Localizable.strings generation.
```

To gather strings in current directory, run:
```
$ find . -name "*.swift" | xargs SwiftGenStrings
```

## Installation

### Prebuilt Binaries

We tag releases and upload prebuilt binaries to GitHub. Checkout the [releases](https://github.com/kayak/SwiftGenStrings/releases) tab or go straight to the [latest](https://github.com/kayak/SwiftGenStrings/releases/latest) release.

### From Git

The project provides a `Makefile`. To export a binary run:

```
$ make release
```

The exported binary can be found under `Products/SwiftGenStrings`

### CocoaPods

A podspec file for the project was released (see [here](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SwiftGenStrings)). However, consumption of SwiftGenStrings through CocoaPods remains experimental at this point.

## Testing

Xcode 9.2 seems to have a bug with running tests against macOS destination, luckily, `xcodebuild` works just fine:
```
$ make test
```

## Requirements

- Xcode 9.2
- Swift 4.0.2

## Limitations

- SwiftGenStrings currently doesn't support multiple tables, only the default one - `Localizable.strings`.
- It is not possible to use `NSLocalizedString` in string interpolation e.g.: `let hello = "--- \(NSLocalizedString("Hello world!", comment: ""))"` will not pickup the localized string.
